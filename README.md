- Adaptive to new cheat variants without updates
- Visualizes threat vectors in 3D space

```lua
-- Sample detection rule
SentinelX.RegisterPattern({
    Name = "InfiniteJump",
    ByteSignature = "0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 EC 08",
    RiskLevel = 9.2,
    Action = "TerminateProcess"
})
```

### ⚡ Zero-Performance Impact
- 0.03% CPU usage during peak operation
- 12MB memory footprint
- DirectX 12-accelerated scanning
